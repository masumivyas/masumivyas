- 👋 Hi, I’m @masumivyas and I am currently a first year engineering student at The University of Western Ontario! I am planning to specialize in Software Engineering in my second year and complete a dual degree along with the Ivey School of Business. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more from others and improving my coding skills!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python and C++!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help develop my software skills and be exposed to more challanging projects.
